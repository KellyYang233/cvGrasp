#Hand grasp recognition from first-person videos
This code project is a mix of multiple tasks (classification and clustering) which may cause confusion to you.
For classfication, please focus on the procedure in function cvGrasp::procYaleGraspClassify() in cvGrasp.cpp.
Sorry for the inconvenience. 

Please cite the following paper if the code helps you:
